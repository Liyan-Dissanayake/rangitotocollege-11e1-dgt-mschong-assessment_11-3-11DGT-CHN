        <h3>The Anuradhapura Kingdom (377 BCE - 1017 CE)</h3>

            <div class="era-info">
                <p>As Sri Lanka's first established kingdom, Anuradhapura flourished for over 1,400 years under 123 monarchs. 
                Notable rulers include King Devanampiya Tissa who introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka, and King Dutugemunu who 
                unified the country. The kingdom was renowned for its sophisticated irrigation systems, majestic stupas like 
                Ruwanwelisaya, and advanced architecture. The sacred Bodhi tree, brought during Devanampiya Tissa's reign, 
                remains the oldest historically documented tree in the world.</p>

        <h3>The Polonnaruwa Kingdom (1056-1236 CE)</h3>

            <div class="era-info">
                <p>Following the decline of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa became the second capital of Sri Lanka. King Vijayabahu I 
                successfully resisted Chola invasions and established Polonnaruwa as a fortified city. The greatest ruler of this 
                era, King Parakramabahu the Great (1153-1186 CE), transformed the city into a magnificent capital with extensive 
                irrigation networks, beautiful palaces, and religious monuments. His reign is considered the golden age of Polonnaruwa, 
                with advancements in agriculture, trade, and architecture that still impress visitors today.</p>

            <div class="era-info">
                <p>The last independent Sinhalese kingdom successfully resisted European colonial powers for over 300 years. 
                Established by Senasammata Vikramabahu, the kingdom reached its zenith under King Rajasinghe II who defeated 
                the Portuguese in several decisive battles. The sacred Temple of the Tooth Relic became the kingdom's spiritual 
                heart. The famous Kandyan Convention of 1815, signed between British officials and Kandyan chiefs, ended Sri Lanka's 
                independence until 1948. The kingdom's unique architecture, dance, and craft traditions continue to define Sri Lankan 
                culture.</p>
